```javascript
const query = {
  field: { $regex: /pattern/i },
};

const cursor = db.collection('myCollection').find(query);
const results = await cursor.toArray();
//In this code, there's a potential issue where the regex `/pattern/i` may be too broad or may inadvertently match unintended documents.  This is especially true if the field is not indexed.
```
